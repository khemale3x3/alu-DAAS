# alu-DAAS
Alu Identifies Data Patterns, scans the webpageâ€™s HTML structure and detects patterns in tables, lists, and repeated elements. Uses CSS selectors to extract text, links, and images. Automatic Pagination Handling: The scraper clicks "Next" buttons automatically to move through pages. Uses delays (min/max) to prevent rate limiting.

 Extracts & Formats Data: It captures links, images, and text from structured data. Exports data as CSV, XLSX, or copied to clipboard.
